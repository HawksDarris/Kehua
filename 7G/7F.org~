Fortunately, the tiger likes bananas, so she *distracts* the tiger with a banana. The tiger takes the banana, and now it can talk. The tiger leads Simone to a little house, where Amy is waiting along with a lot of treasure. The tiger starts coughing; oh no! He was allergic to bananas so he suddenly dies.
