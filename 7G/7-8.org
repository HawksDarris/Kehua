*** Falling Up 🙃
I tripped on my shoelace👟

And I fell up—

Up to the roof tops🏠,

Up over the town,

Up past the tree tops,

Up over the mountains🏔️,

Up where the colors

Blend into the sounds.

But it got me so dizzy🥴

When I looked around,

I got sick to my stomach🤒

And I threw down.

*** What If?
#+begin_leftcol
Last night, while I lay thinking🤔 here,

some "Whatifs" crawled inside my ear👂

and pranced and partied 🕺 all night long

and sang their same old "What if" song:

What if I'm dumb in school?

What if they've closed the swimming pool?

What if I get beat🤛🥊 up?
#+end_leftcol

What if there's poison☠️ in my cup?

What if I start to cry😢?

What if a bolt of lightning⚡ strikes me?

What if I don't grow taller?

What if my head starts getting smaller?

What if the fish🐟 won't bite?

What if the wind tears up my kite🪁?

What if they start a war🪖?

What if my parents get divorced💔?

What if the bus🚌 is late⌛?

What if my teeth don't grow in straight?

What if I tear my pants👖?

What if I never learn to dance🕺?

Everything seems well, and then

the nighttime Whatifs strike again!

In 1066, France 🇫🇷 conquered England 🇬🇧, and French people did not want to learn English. English was the poor people's language. French was the rich💰 people's language. The new king of England did not even speak English. In /official situations/, people /were not allowed/ to speak English. Even until the 1700s, many "English" courts 🧑‍⚖️ did everything in French.

Basically, if the animal was alive in the field, the only person talking about it was the poor farmer speaking English. If the animal was dead ☠️ and on the plate 🍽️, the important, rich, French people were talking about it.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-left)

There is a student named Simon. Simon is in a small house in a forest. Simon goes into the forest. OH NO! He sees some tigers.

Ethan and Corry are in the forest too because they want to hunt tigers. Corry has a gun, but Ethan does not have a gun because he wants to make a rifle himself in the forest. When Corry sees the tigers, he shoots one!
#+end_leftcol

#+begin_rightcol
But Ethan did not shoot a tiger because he is slow at making a gun himself. Now Jack is here. OMG, he's so hungry, but he doesn't want to shoot anything because he hates guns. He saw that Corry had just killed a tiger, so he begged: "PLEASE, Corry! Please let me have a piece of your tiger to eat! I am so hungry!"
#+end_rightcol

*** The Tigers are Maaaad 😡
#+begin_leftcol
Ethan made his gun, but there is a problem. He does not make a rifle! He made an RPG! (How???) He does not want an RPG, he wants a rifle!
#+end_leftcol

#+begin_rightcol
The tigers see Corry shoot their friend, so the tigers are mad! (Oh no!) Everyone runs away from the tigers.

The tigers are slow because one tiger is blind (he has no eyes), and the other tiger has no tail. /(Not very 跑得快.)/ Because the tigers are not fast, everyone gets away. Everyone runs until they are tired.

Once upon a time, there was a student named Simone. Simone lived in a small house beside a forest. One day, Simone decided to explore the forest... Simone was hungry, so she looked around and found a fruit tree. But OH NO, a tiger was there! She ignored the tiger while she chopped down the tree, which was a banana tree. Fortunately, the tiger likes bananas, so she /distracts/ the tiger with a banana. The tiger takes the banana, and now it can talk. The tiger leads Simone to a little house, where Amy is waiting along with a lot of treasure. The tiger starts coughing; oh no! He was allergic to bananas so he suddenly dies.

*** Oh no, they're sick...
Amy and Simone are hungry so they eat the tiger, but they forgot to cook it, so they get sick and throw up. It was *not* /easy peasy lemon squeezy/.
