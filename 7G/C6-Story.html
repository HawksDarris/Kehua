      <h2>Class Story</h2>
      <p> Once upon a time, there was a student named Simone. Simone lived in a small house beside a forest. One day, Simone decided to explore the forest... Simone was hungry, so she looked around and found a fruit tree. But OH NO, a tiger was there! She ignored the tiger while she chopped down the tree, which was a banana tree. Fortunately, the tiger likes bananas, so she distracts the tiger with a banana. The tiger takes the banana, and now it can talk. The tiger leads Simone to a little house, where Amy is waiting along with a lot of treasure. The tiger starts coughing; oh no! He was allergic to bananas so he suddenly dies. </p>
      <p>Amy and Simone are hungry so they eat the tiger, but they forgot to cook it, so they get sick and throw up. It was <em>not</em> easy peasy lemon squeezy.</p>
