      <!-- <h1>The Story</h1> -->

      <!-- Wang was a blind magician who could make anything disappear, even his own apologies! -->
      <!-- One day, he woke up in a world where everything was upside down, and he found himself on a roller coaster ride through a vineyard filled with talking grapes! Wang, being the adventurous spirit that he was, decided to go backpacking on a flying carpet with his guide elephant. Finally, they reached the coast where they found the ultimate treasure - a jar of peanut butter that could grant wishes!  -->
