* COMMENT Witness Statement
MY first thought was "This woman wants me to work all night for just her necklace and she doesn't even ask my name? That is so rude!" I just wanted to adopt a baby! My wife was so excited!

I could tell she was distraught so I decided to play a little game with her: Guess my name.
