* Last week
** Law Questions for Anne
1. Anne says she didn't _REALLY_ accept the contract.
2. Anne says she completed the contract because she "guessed" Rumpelstiltskin's name.
3. Anne says the contract is illegal.

** Law Questions for Rumpelstiltskin
1. Rumpelstiltskin says Anne _DID REALLY_ accept the contract
2. Rumpelstiltskin says the contract is legal

* So what is the law?
** The Laws I Made
1. Contracts with extraordinarily unequal exchange are not valid.
2. Contracts with extraordinarily unethical terms are not valid
3. A contract is invalid if acceptance is forced by another person, and both sides know about it.


** That's the law

#+REVEAL_HTML: <p style=color:red>Tell me about the case. Tell me what you are going to show and how you are going to show it. Tell me why the other side is wrong. It's a map.</p>

"You are going to hear Anne say she was FORCED to agree to give away her BABY! Next, you will hear from..."

** Direct
#+REVEAL_HTML: <p style=color:red>Ask questions from people who are with you. Help them tell the story.</p>

** Cross
#+REVEAL_HTML: <p style=color:red>Ask questions from people who are against you. Make them look bad.</p>

"You were scared the king was going to kill you, right?"

"Yes."

"But you married him."

"Well, I love him"

"So you didn't think he's going to kill you?"

"I did! But I don't think so now..."

** Cross
"Now, you love him."

"Right"

"He has lots of gold, right?"

"Yes, but that's not why I love him!"

"But you did marry him because he is the king"

"That is part of the reason"

"And you are not afraid of him."

"Not now..."
