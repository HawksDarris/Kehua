Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my name is **Darris Hawks**, and I represent Rumpelstiltskin. This case is about a broken deal, a contract between my client and Anne Miller.$\footnote{theme}$ My client, Rumpelstiltskin, helped Anne when she needed it most by turning straw into gold. In exchange, Anne agreed to give him her first child. Instead of keeping her promise, Anne wants a way to break the contract.

Rumpelstiltskin kept his end of the deal. He worked all night, not once, not twice, but three times, to turn straw into gold for Anne, saving her life and making her a queen! But when it was time for Anne to do her part, she said no. She SCAMMED$\footnote{骗局}$ Rumpelstiltskin and says the deal is invalid because she guessed his name. She wants you to believe that Rumpelstiltskin said "You don't have to pay me if you tell me my name." Is that reasonable$\footnote{合理的}$ ? No. It is ridiculous.$\footnote{荒谬的}$ We are here today to prove that the contract was fair, and that Anne Miller knew exactly what she was agreeing to.

Our witnesses will show that **Anne was not forced to accept this contract**, and even if$\footnote{即使}$ the King did force Anne, Rumpelstiltskin did not know about it. We will also prove that **the contract was not unethical**, but that it was a fair exchange for a magical service only Rumpelstiltskin could give. The straw-into-gold work was amazing, and what Rumpelstiltskin did is just as valuable as the promise Anne made in return: To give Rumpelstiltskin a child he could love and take care of.


Our expert witness, **Professor Goldsmith**, will testify that the exchange of gold for the baby was not extraordinarily unequal. In fact, Goldsmith will tell you that the deal was quite reasonable. She will also argue that a royal baby is no more valuable than any other child, and could even be less valuable.

By the end of this trial, you will see that Rumpelstiltskin was treated unfairly. The deal was made, the work was done, and Anne Miller owes Rumpelstiltskin what she promised. That is your job. After you hear all of the proof$\footnote{证明}$, you will have to answer three questions: 

1. Was Anne Miller forced by King Theo to make the contract? If yes, Did Rumpelstiltskin know King Theo forced her? 
2. Was the "baby for gold" deal extraordinarily unethical? 
3. Was the "baby for gold" deal extraordinarily unequal? 

By the end of this, we hope to make you think the answer to all of those questions is "No." Thank you.
