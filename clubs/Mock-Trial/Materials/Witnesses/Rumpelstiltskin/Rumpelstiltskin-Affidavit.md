# Affidavit of Rumpelstiltskin

```{=latex}
\linenumbers
```
My name is Rumpelstiltskin. I am 1,525 years old. I have a business, and I am my own boss. I can do something nobody else can do: I can turn straw into gold. However, I am very lonely. I have lived many years with no family and only a few friends. Because I can turn straw into gold, many people ask for my help, but what can they pay me with? Gold? I do not need gold! So I always ask for a different kind of payment. I always try to be fair and reasonable. 

I met Anne Miller when she scammed me$\footnote{她骗了我}$  last summer. The King had wanted to meet me (kings always want to meet me), so I had gone to see him. When I was there, I heard a man tell the King his daughter could turn straw into gold and the man brought his daughter to prove it. I had never known a person who could do what I can do, so I wanted to meet her! However, soon I heard somebody crying from one of the King's rooms. I asked her what was wrong. She told me the King was going to kill her father for lying if she could not turn straw into gold. I felt very bad for this woman, so I offered to help her if she gave me her ring.
