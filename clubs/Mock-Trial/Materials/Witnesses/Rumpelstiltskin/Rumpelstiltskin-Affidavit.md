# Test

My name is Rumpelstiltskin. I am 525 years old. I have a business, and I am my own boss. I can do something nobody else can do: I can turn straw into gold. However, I am very lonely. I have lived many years with no family and only a few friends. Because I can turn straw into gold, many people ask for my help, but what can they pay me with? Gold? I do not need gold! So I always ask for a different kind of payment. I always try to be fair and reasonable.
