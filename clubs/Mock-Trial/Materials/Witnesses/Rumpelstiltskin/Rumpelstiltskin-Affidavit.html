<h1>Affidavit of Rumpelstiltskin</h1>
<p>My name is Rumpelstiltskin. I am 1,525 years old. I have a business,
and I am my own boss. I can do something nobody else can do: I can turn
straw into gold. However, I am very lonely. I have lived many years with
no family and only a few friends. Because I can turn straw into gold,
many people ask for my help, but what can they pay me with? Gold? I do
not need gold! So I always ask for a different kind of payment. I always
try to be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>I met Anne Miller when she scammed me<span
class="math inline">$\footnote{她骗了我}$</span> last summer. The King
had wanted to meet me (kings always want to meet me), so I had gone to
see him. When I was there, I heard a man tell the King his daughter
could turn straw into gold and the man brought his daughter to prove it.
I had never known a person who could do what I can do, so I wanted to
meet her! However, soon I heard somebody crying from one of the King’s
rooms. I asked her what was wrong. She told me the King was going to
kill her father for lying if she could not turn straw into gold. I felt
very bad for this woman, so I offered to help her if she gave me her
ring. But that wasn’t enough for the King, and he wanted her to do it
again, so I helped her again, and she gave me her necklace. After that,
the King made her do it again, but this time he said he would marry her
if she did it! At that point, I became suspicious<span
class="math inline">$\footnote{怀疑}$</span>. I think she was working
together with the King to scam me into making a lot of gold for them.
She was so rude! I thought she was only worried that the King would kill
her father, but now I see she and the King were on the same team. After
I finished working all night on the second night, before I left, I
remember saying, “Sorry we have not really introduced ourselves yet,
What is your name?” and she just said “Anne.” and turned around.
Extremely rude. She never even asked what my name was. Even though I was
suspicious, I did not want her father to die, so I agreed to help her
one more time. You have to understand: I have been alone for so long. To
help her before her marriage, I asked her to give me her and the King’s
first baby so I could have a family, too. I just want someone to
love.</p>
<p>So, about one year later, Anne had a baby. I was so happy. I
raced<span class="math inline">$\footnote{went very fast}$</span> to the
King’s castle to bring my baby home. I was shocked and outraged when she
wanted to pay me in some other way. She promised me a baby, and I had
done everything right, but she still did not want to pay me. I was
heartbroken. I told her, “You never even asked my name!” and she became
very strange. Every day, she asked me if my name was John, Stanley,
Steven, Richard, etc. Every day, I asked her, “Why are you guessing
names?” and every day, I told her “My name is very strange, please stop
guessing.” After about a week, I guess she asked my neighbor what my
name was because she screamed “RUMPELSTILTSKIN!!! Now I don’t have to
give you my baby!”</p>
<p>What? That is <em>NOT</em> what we agreed! Why would I agree to that?
What a stupid thing to say. She never gave me my child. I have cried
myself to sleep every night. I do not even have the energy to turn straw
into gold now. I feel like Anne destroyed my life. So I paid a lawyer to
sue her, and that is why I made wrote this statement.</p>
