# Affidavit of Anne Miller

```{=latex}
\linenumbers
```

My name is **Queen** Anne Miller. I am the Queen. You probably know who I am because I am so rich and famous. I do not have a job because I am the Queen, so people will bring me anything I want. I am here because that ugly, weird, little creep$\footnote{怪人}$, Rumpelstiltskin, is suing$\footnote{起诉}$ me after he tried to take my baby. 

My father and my husband, King Theo, are very good friends. When my father introduced us, the King fell in love with me instantly because I am so smart and beautiful. We talked all day and all night for three days, and, after three days, my little Teddy-poo (that's what I call King Theo), asked me to marry him. I said yes because I wanted to be Queen, but I do love my little Teddy-poo. 

## How did she meet Rumpelstiltskin?

## What is her side of the story?

### Address why she was guessing names and whether she ever hired Rumpelstiltskin at all
