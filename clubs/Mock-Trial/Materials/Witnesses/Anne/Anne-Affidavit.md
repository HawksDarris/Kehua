# Affidavit of Anne Miller

```{=latex}
\linenumbers
```

My name is **Queen** Anne Miller. I am the Queen. You probably know who I am because I am so rich and famous. I do not have a job because I am the Queen, so people will bring me anything I want. I am here because that ugly, weird, little creep$\footnote{怪人}$, Rumpelstiltskin, is suing$\footnote{起诉}$ me after he tried to take my baby. 

My father and my husband, King Theo, are very good friends. When my father introduced us, the King fell in love with me instantly because I am so smart and beautiful. We talked all day and all night for three days, and, after three days, my little Teddy-poo (that's what I call King Theo), asked me to marry him. I said yes because I wanted to be Queen.

Some people are saying that my father told the King that I could spin straw into gold, but that is not true. My father never said that. The King wanted gold, and there was a lot of straw, but I had no idea how to turn it into gold. That’s when Rumpelstiltskin showed up. I didn’t ask for his help--he appeared on his own and asked me for my name. I did not ask him what his name was because I did not care. He told me he could spin the straw into gold, but I think he did it because he wanted to impress me. He looked at me like he was in love with me because I’m so beautiful. I didn’t think much of him at first because, well, he’s a bit strange and not very handsome, but I let him do it.

Rumpelstiltskin did spin the straw into gold, but then he asked for something in return. The first night, I gave him my necklace. The second night, I gave him my ring. I wasn’t really sure why he wanted these things, but I just wanted to get through it. He seemed happy to help me because of how much he liked me because I am so pretty. Maybe he wanted to help me because he knew Teddy-poo liked me. 

Then, on the third night, he asked for something completely crazy--he said he wanted my first child! I thought he was joking, so I said yes, but I thought it would never actually happen. After my baby was born, I was so happy. But then Rumpelstiltskin came back! He said he wanted to take my baby, like we agreed. I couldn’t believe it. I would never let anyone take my child. I begged him not to, and that’s when he gave me a chance to guess his name. He said if I could guess his name, he would not take my baby. I started guessing names because it was the only way to keep my baby safe.

I never wanted anything from Rumpelstiltskin. He just wanted to show off for me because he thought I was beautiful, and now he’s trying to take my baby away!
