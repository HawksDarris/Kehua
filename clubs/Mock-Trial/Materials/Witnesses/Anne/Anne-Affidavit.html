<h1>Affidavit of Anne Miller</h1>
<p>My name is <strong>Queen</strong> Anne Miller. I am the Queen. You
probably know who I am because I am so rich and famous. I do not have a
job because I am the Queen, so people will bring me anything I want. I
am here because that ugly, weird, little creep<span
class="math inline">$\footnote{怪人}$</span>, Rumpelstiltskin, is
suing<span class="math inline">$\footnote{起诉}$</span> me after he
tried to take my baby.</p>
<p>My father and my husband, King Theo, are very good friends. When my
father introduced us, the King fell in love with me instantly because I
am so smart and beautiful. We talked all day and all night for three
days, and, after three days, my little Teddy-poo (that’s what I call
King Theo), asked me to marry him. I said yes because I wanted to be
Queen.</p>
<p>Some people are saying that my father told the King that I could spin
straw into gold, but that is not true. My father never said that. The
King wanted gold, and there was a lot of straw, but I had no idea how to
turn it into gold. That’s when Rumpelstiltskin showed up. I didn’t ask
for his help–he appeared on his own and asked me for my name. I did not
ask him what his name was because I did not care. He told me he could
spin the straw into gold, but I think he did it because he wanted to
impress me. He looked at me like he was in love with me because I’m so
beautiful. I didn’t think much of him at first because, well, he’s a bit
strange and not very handsome, but I let him do it.</p>
<p>Rumpelstiltskin did spin the straw into gold, but then he asked for
something in return. The first night, I gave him my necklace. The second
night, I gave him my ring. I wasn’t really sure why he wanted these
things, but I just wanted to get through it. He seemed happy to help me
because of how much he liked me because I am so pretty. Maybe he wanted
to help me because he knew Teddy-poo liked me.</p>
<p>Then, on the third night, he asked for something completely crazy–he
said he wanted my first child! I thought he was joking, so I said yes,
but I thought it would never actually happen. After my baby was born, I
was so happy. But then Rumpelstiltskin came back! He said he wanted to
take my baby, like we agreed. I couldn’t believe it. I would never let
anyone take my child. I begged him not to, and that’s when he gave me a
chance to guess his name. He said if I could guess his name, he would
not take my baby. I started guessing names because it was the only way
to keep my baby safe.</p>
<p>I never wanted anything from Rumpelstiltskin. He just wanted to show
off for me because he thought I was beautiful, and now he’s trying to
take my baby away!</p>
