# Witness Statement: Selina Cottage

My name is **Selina Cottage**. I live in the same forest as **Rumpelstiltskin**, and we’ve been neighbors for a long many years. Rumpelstiltskin is not the kind of person Anne Miller is trying to make him look like. I know him well, and he has always been fair when making deals with others.

I found out about this case because the King's Guard knocked on my door one day, asking if I knew Rumpelstiltskin's name. They were looking for it, but I didn't know why at the time. They didn't explain much, and I told them his name. They just said, "Thank you," and left. Later, Rumpelstiltskin came to me and told me what had happened. He said that Anne Miller had been guessing names at him and he had no idea why. Now I know it is because she says Rumpelstiltskin made a game out of it so she would not have to pay him... Strange.

Rumpelstiltskin told me how it all started. He helped Anne when she was in trouble. She promised to give him her first baby in exchange for spinning straw into gold. In the magical world, these kinds of promises are taken very seriously. Rumpelstiltskin doesn’t do anything for free, and he was clear with Anne about what she would have to give him in return for his help. I would never make a deal for a baby--that feels evil. But I know Rumpelstiltskin seems lonely and I am sure he would take good care of the baby. 

Anne knew exactly what she was agreeing to. I’ve known Rumpelstiltskin a long time, and he never hides the cost of his deals. He doesn’t cheat or lie. He told me that when the time came to collect on the deal, Anne refused to give him the child. She didn’t even ask him what his name was when they met. She sent the King's Guard all over the kingdom to spy on him and find out his name. She is crazy.

I believe Rumpelstiltskin is telling the truth here. She acted like she was nice, but she was planning to break the deal from the start.
