# Expert Witness Statement: Professor Harold T. Worthington

My name is **Professor Harold T. Worthington**, and I study economics and how we value$\footnote{价值}$ things. I teach at Zhejiang University and have written many articles about the value of goods and human life.

I have prepared a report called "The Value of Human Life: Comparing Royal$\footnote{皇家}$  and Non-Royal Babies." In the report, I looked at the contract between Rumpelstiltskin and Anne Miller about turning straw into gold for a human baby.

Based on my research, I believe that this exchange was NOT an "extraordinarily unequal" deal. I argue that all human babies, whether royal or not, are equal in value. Or, if not equal, the royal baby is actually worth less than the non-royal baby. The idea that a royal baby is more valuable than a regular baby is not true. 

From a moral point of view, we cannot easily value a human life, but of course it is possible to do it from a business point of view. I read Dr. Goldsmith's report, and I think it is ridiculous.$\footnote{荒谬的}$ We can see that a baby is probably going to grow up and get a job and start to earn money. If we add up all the money that person will make in their life, that is the value of that person's life. Three giant rooms full of gold for a baby that would probably never earn money because royals do not work is far from unequal. If it is extraordinarily unequal, it is extraordinarily unequal **for Rumpelstiltskin**--he is the one spending too much. 

Rumpelstiltskin’s service of turning straw into gold is a fair deal if human lives have the same value. So, if the value of the gold is similar to the value of any baby's lifetime money, the exchange is reasonable. 

In conclusion, I say that this exchange was not extraordinarily unequal, and the idea that royal babies are worth more than other babies is not supported by facts. I am ready to share my report as evidence for this trial.
