# Expert Witness Statement: Professor Harold T. Worthington

My name is **Professor Harold T. Worthington**, and I study economics and how we value. I teach at Zhejiang University and have written many articles about the value of goods and human life.

I have prepared a report called "The Value of Human Life: Comparing Royal and Non-Royal Babies." In this report, I look at the deal between Rumpelstiltskin and Anne Miller about turning straw into gold for a human baby.

Based on my research, I believe that this exchange was NOT an "extraordinarily unequal" deal. I argue that all human babies, whether royal or not, are worth the same. The idea that a royal baby is more valuable than a regular baby is not true. This belief comes from social status, not actual value.

From an economic point of view, we cannot put a money value on human life. The importance placed on a royal baby does not change the basic worth of any child. While the royal family may think a royal heir is special, this does not mean they are worth more than other babies.

In my analysis, Rumpelstiltskinâ€™s service of turning straw into gold can be seen as a fair deal if we accept that all human lives have the same value. So, if the value of the gold is similar to the value of any baby, the exchange is reasonable.

However, I acknowledge that some people might feel differently. They may argue that a royal baby could have greater importance for the kingdom or future leadership. This could make it seem like the deal was unequal. But in my expert opinion, the actual life value remains the same.

In conclusion, I say that this exchange was not extraordinarily unequal, and the idea that royal babies are worth more than other babies is not supported by facts. I am ready to share my report as evidence for this trial.
