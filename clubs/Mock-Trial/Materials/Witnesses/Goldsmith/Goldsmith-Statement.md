# Witness Statement: Dr. Alex Goldsmith

My name is **Dr. Alex Goldsmith**, and I am an expert in Unequal Exchange. I have a Ph.D. in Economics from Tsinghua University and have spent over twenty years researching the cost of goods and services. I have prepared a report titled "The Value$\footnote{价值}$ of Rumpelstiltskin’s Straw to Gold Service."

In my report, I look at Rumpelstiltskin and Anne Miller's exchange of one baby for turning straw into gold. It is my expert opinion that this exchange is "extraordinarily unequal." A human life, especially a royal$\footnote{皇家}$ baby's life, is worth so much more than gold in moral. 

I tried to measure how much the straw-to-gold service is worth using basic economic ideas. I was not able to find the worth of his service because it is so rare, but the price of straw and time to make gold is nowhere near to the price of a human child. Even if we guessed how much the gold is worth in money, it would still be much less than the true value of a life.

I have read Dr. Worthington's report, and I am surprised$\footnote{我很惊讶} that it says a baby's life can be valued just by adding up how much money the baby would earn. There are so many other things to think about. For example, what is the price of holding your baby? How much does it cost to hear your baby's laugh?

I admit that my calculations might not completely work for a royal baby. The importance of a royal heir goes beyond regular money values. In a royal family, the value of a child includes not just wealth but also things like future leadership of the country.

My analysis shows that the deal was extraordinarily unequal. I am prepared to enter my report into evidence for this trial.
