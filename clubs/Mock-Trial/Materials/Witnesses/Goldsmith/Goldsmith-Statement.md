# Expert Witness Statement: Dr. Alex Goldsmith

My name is **Dr. Alex Goldsmith**, and I am an expert in valuation. I have a Ph.D. in Economics from Tsinghua University and have spent over twenty years researching valuation of goods and services. I have prepared a report entitled "Evaluating the Value of Rumpelstiltskinâ€™s Straw to Gold Service: An Analysis of Extraordinary Inequality."

In my report, I analyze the transaction between Rumpelstiltskin and Anne Miller concerning the exchange of straw into gold for a human baby. It is my expert opinion that this arrangement is indeed "extraordinarily unequal." The value of a human life, especially a royal baby, is immeasurable in moral and ethical terms. 

Using common economic principles, I attempted to quantify the value of the straw-to-gold service. The cost of materials, time, and effort in producing gold from straw does not come close to the value of a human child. Even if one were to estimate the monetary value of gold produced, it would be significantly lower than the inherent value of a life. 

However, I must concede, with reservations, that my calculations might not fully apply to a royal baby. The social, political, and emotional value placed on a royal heir could elevate the perceived worth far beyond standard economic measures. In royal contexts, the value of a child encompasses not just material wealth but also legacy, power, and future governance.

In conclusion, while my analysis supports the claim that the transaction was extraordinarily unequal, I acknowledge that the unique circumstances of royal lineage may complicate a straightforward valuation. Therefore, it is essential to consider both the ethical implications and the specific context of such an exchange.

I am prepared to enter my report into evidence for this trial.
