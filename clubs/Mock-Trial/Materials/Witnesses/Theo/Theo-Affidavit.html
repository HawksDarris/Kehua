<h1>Affidavit of King Theo</h1>
<p>My name is Theo Windsor, and I am the King of this country. Being a
King is quite enjoyable. I get to wear a magnificent crown and host
extravagant parties with delicious food. But honestly, sometimes it
feels more like a burden than a blessing. I’d much rather be doing
something more important than sitting here talking to you about this
trivial matter.</p>
<p>Now, let me tell you about my wife, Anne. I was quite clever to marry
her. It benefited the kingdom, you see. She comes from a poor family, so
it makes me look generous and kind. People love to think they understand
the royal family, but they really don’t know much at all. Yes, Anne is a
little self-centered, but that’s just part of her charm, I suppose.</p>
<p>I met her after instructing some of my workers to find a suitable
match. They brought me a man I had heard of, but whom I didn’t know very
well. When I met Anne, I thought, “Ah, here’s a woman who can serve my
interests well.” Now everyone thinks I believed she could turn straw
into gold. What a ridiculous idea! Non-royal people can be quite
foolish. I tire of their nonsense.</p>
<p>Now, Rumpelstiltskin claims he had some sort of contract with Anne,
stating that he turned straw into gold to save her from me. Why would I
kill her?! I was never going to kill her. That would be useless. I
wanted a queen to support me, not someone to kill.</p>
<p>My wife told me Rumpelstiltskin wanted a baby in exchange for his
help, but I never agreed to anything! My goal was to marry someone who
could unite the kingdom. And what about me? You think Anne can give away
my baby without my permission? My wife also told me that, if she guessed
Rumpelstiltskin’s name, we could keep the baby. Why not just ask him his
name? Nonsense. Who would want a contract like that? It feels more like
a game than something serious. Who would offer a king’s baby for a small
amount of gold? Who would cancel a contract for guessing a name? It’s
silly. This is all silly.</p>
<p>This is all beneath me. I have more important things to do.</p>
