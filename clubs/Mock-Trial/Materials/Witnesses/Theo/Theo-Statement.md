# Witness Statement of King Theo

```{=latex}
\linenumbers
```

My name is Theo Windsor, and I am the King of this country. Being a King is quite enjoyable. I get to wear a magnificent crown and host extravagant parties with delicious food. But honestly, sometimes it feels more like a burden than a blessing. I’d much rather be doing something more important than sitting here talking to you about this trivial matter.

Now, let me tell you about my wife, Anne. I was quite clever to marry her. It benefited the kingdom, you see. She comes from a poor family, so it makes me look generous and kind. People love to think they understand the royal family, but they really don’t know much at all. Yes, Anne is a little self-centered, but that’s just part of her charm, I suppose. 

I met her after instructing some of my workers to find a suitable match. They brought me a man I had heard of, but whom I didn’t know very well. When I met Anne, I thought, “Ah, here’s a woman who can serve my interests well.” Now everyone thinks I believed she could turn straw into gold. What a ridiculous idea! Non-royal people can be quite foolish. I tire of their nonsense.

Now, Rumpelstiltskin claims he had some sort of contract with Anne, stating that he turned straw into gold to save her from me. Why would I kill her?! I was never going to kill her. That would be useless. I wanted a queen to support me, not someone to kill. 

My wife told me Rumpelstiltskin wanted a baby in exchange for his help, but I never agreed to anything! My goal was to marry someone who could unite the kingdom. And what about me? You think Anne can give away my baby without my permission? My wife also told me that, if she guessed Rumpelstiltskin's name, we could keep the baby. Why not just ask him his name? Nonsense. Who would want a contract like that? It feels more like a game than something serious. Who would offer a king's baby for a small amount of gold? Who would cancel a contract for guessing a name? It's silly. This is all silly.

This is all beneath me. I have more important things to do.
