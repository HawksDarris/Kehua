Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my name is **Darris Hawks**, and together with my colleague$\footnote{同事}$ Lucas Fan, we represent **Anne Miller** in this case. We are here because Rumpelstiltskin is demanding something that no mother would ever give up: her baby. We will show you that this contract was **forced**, and was extraordinarily **unethical**, and **unequal**.

First, let’s talk about **force**. You will hear from Anne herself, who will explain how she thought her life was at risk. The King wanted her to turn straw into gold or face death. Rumpelstiltskin arrived and took advantage$\footnote{利用}$ of the situation. Anne had no choice. Rumpelstiltskin wants you to believe he did not think Anne was being forced to accept this contract. Members of the jury, will you believe that a woman would give up her baby without being forced? Our witnesses will prove that **Rumpelstiltskin knew or should have known** that Anne was being forced into this deal by King Theo.

Second, this deal is **unethical**. Giving up a **child** for gold is extraordinarily unethical. Our expert witness, **Dr. Goldsmith**, will testify that asking for a human child in exchange for any service is an unethical demand. We will show you that this contract was not just crazy, but also unethical.
j
Finally, this was an **extraordinarily unequal** deal. Rumpelstiltskin, with his special ability to spin straw into gold, made something valuable, yes, but equal to a human life? No. Never. **A child’s value is much more gold's**, no matter how much was created. Dr. Goldsmith will explain how the value of a baby's life cannot be calculated. 

At the end of this trial$\footnote{诉讼}$, you will be asked three questions, but you only need to answer yes to one of them. The first question: Was Anne Miller forced by King Theo to make the contract, and did Rumpelstiltskin know about it? If you say yes to that question, the contract is invalid, and Anne gets to keep her beautiful baby. We think we can prove that. But if you do not think we proved it after the trial, you will be asked these two questions: 

1. Was the "baby for gold" deal extraordinarily unethical? Well, it was selling a baby, so yes.

2. Was the "baby for gold" deal extraordinarily unequal? Is a baby worth gold? No. Babies are priceless. 

Please help us give Anne back her baby.
