# Opening Statement Template

Your Honormy name is $\blankline$, and I and my partner $\blankline$,$\footnote{the other lawyer}$ represent Anne Miller in today's case. We will provethat Rumpelstiltskin is 


Your Honor$\footnote{法官应该这样对待}$, members of the jury $\footnote{陪审团成员}$,  my name is **Attorney Jane Smith**, and I and my partner **Attorney John Doe** represent Anne Miller in today's case$\footnote{法庭案件}$. We intend to prove$\footnote{我们想要证明}$ that Anne Miller never made a contract with Rumpelstiltskin. We also intend to prove that, even if she had made a contract, the contract would be invalid. When we are done, the judge will ask you these questions:

1. Was there a contract between Rumpelstiltskin? 
2. If there was a contract
  - Was the exchange in the contract extraordinarily unequal?
  - Were the terms of the contract extraordinarily unethical?
  - Was Anne's acceptance of the contract forced because of another person? 
    - Did Rumpelstiltskin know about it? 

First, we will show that the **exchange** between Rumpelstiltskin and Anne was **extraordinarily unequal**. Rumpelstiltskin wanted Anne’s baby in exchange for turning straw into gold. A human baby cannot be compared to gold. A baby's life is priceless, while Rumpelstiltskin can always make more gold. This makes the contract unfair and not valid.

Second, we will demonstrate that the terms of this contract were extraordinarily unethical. Rumpelstiltskin asked for Anne's first child as payment. This is not only wrong, it is completely unacceptable. No one should ever be forced to give up a child, and this shows that the agreement was morally wrong.

Finally, we will prove that Anne was under pressure when she agreed to the contract. Rumpelstiltskin used tricks and threats, and both parties were aware of this pressure. Anne felt she had no choice but to agree to save herself and her father. Under these conditions, the contract cannot be valid.

In conclusion, we ask the court to recognize that Anne Miller was treated unfairly in this deal. We will present evidence and witnesses to support our case, and we trust that justice will be served for Anne today. Thank you.
