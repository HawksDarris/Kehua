      <h3>What is Elephant Wine?</h3>
      <p>
        Evia is blind. She has a <em>guide elephant</em>. Her guide elephant is her eyes. She gets on top of her guide elephant and they go to a big elevator. The elevator takes Evia and her guide elephant underground. Evia gets off her guide elephant, which is named <em>Tiger</em>, and leads the elephant to a big barrel of grapes. The elephant steps on the grapes. That's why it's called "Elephant Wine".
