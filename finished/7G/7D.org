Ethan and Corry are in the forest too because they want to hunt tigers. Corry has a gun, but Ethan does not have a gun because he wants to make a rifle himself in the forest. When Corry sees the tigers, he shoots one!
:::

** Ethan did not shoot a tiger.
But Ethan did not shoot a tiger because he is slow at making a gun himself. Now Jack is here. OMG, he's so hungry, but he doesn't want to shoot anything because he hates guns. He saw that Corry had just killed a tiger, so he begged: "PLEASE, Corry! Please let me have a piece of your tiger to eat! I am so hungry!"

The tigers are slow because one tiger is blind (he has no eyes), and the other tiger has no tail. /(Not very Ë∑ëÂæóÂø´.)/ Because the tigers are not fast, everyone gets away. Everyone runs until they are tired.

Simone was hungry, so she looked around and found a fruit tree. But OH NO, a tiger was there! She ignored the tiger while she chopped down the tree, which was a banana tree. Fortunately, the tiger likes bananas, so she *distracts* the tiger with a banana. The tiger takes the banana, and now it can talk. The tiger leads Simone to a little house, where Amy is waiting along with a lot of treasure. The tiger starts coughing; oh no! He was allergic to bananas so he suddenly dies.
:::

** Oh no, they're sick

Amy and Simone are hungry so they eat the tiger, but they forgot to cook it, so they get sick and throw up. It was **not** *easy peasy lemon squeezy*.
