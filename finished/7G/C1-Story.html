      <p>
        There is a student named Miki. Miki is in a small house in a forest. One day, Miki goes into the forest because she wants to go to the lake. There is a mini green duck in the lake. The duck has no eyes, so the duck is blind. Kobe is swimming with the duck. He is the duck's dog and helper. The duck can talk. He says "Kobe is my eyes." Miki says "...Huh? A talking duck?!"

        The duck ignores Miki and tells Kobe to lead him to his vineyard.
