        There is a student named Eric. Eric is in a small house in a forest. Eric goes into the forest. He does not like the forest. He prefers to go to the toilet. But he cannot find the toilet because he is blind. He can't go to the toilet because he is blind because his teacher got angry at him for his bad marks and poked his eyes! So now he has an animal to help him.
