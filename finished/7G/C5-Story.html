        Ethan and Corry are in the forest too because they want to hunt tigers. Corry has a gun, but Ethan does not have a gun because he wants to make a rifle himself in the forest. When Corry sees the tigers, he shoots one! But Ethan did not shoot a tiger because he is slow at making a gun himself.

              Now Jack is here. OMG, he's so hungry, but he doesn't want to shoot anything because he hates guns. He saw that Corry had just killed a tiger, so he begged: "PLEASE, Corry! Please let me have a piece of your tiger to eat! I am so hungry!" Ethan made his gun, but there is a problem. He does not make a rifle! He made an RPG! (How???) He does not want an RPG, he wants a rifle!

           The tigers see Corry shoot their friend, so the tigers are mad! (Oh no!) Everyone runs away from the tigers.

              The tigers are slow because one tiger is blind (he has no eyes), and the other tiger has no tail. <em>(Not very 跑得快.)</em> Because the tigers are not fast, everyone gets away. Everyone runs until they are tired.
