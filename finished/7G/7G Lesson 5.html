                Once upon a time, in the beautiful country of France, there was a person named Pierre. Pierre was cheerful and hard-working. He worked at a vineyard on top of a mountain all day and all night, taking care of the grapevines. He was patient and smart, probably the most <em>successful</em> member of his family.

                One day, while Pierre was working in the vineyard, he forgot his lunch. He noticed he could smell the delicious fresh-baked bread. Pierre was hungry but either he could finish his work or he could go to the store to buy some food. He decided to be strict about his work and not give up.
