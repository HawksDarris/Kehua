# Background

I am an American attorney, licensed in Texas. I lived in Scotland for a while (and my son was born there), but I have now left the UK. My family and I would like to (re-)relocate to the UK.

# My Experience

I currently run a solo virtual firm where I focus on business entity formation, asset protection, and estate planning. I have previously worked for an immigration law firm and for a charity for people who could not afford attorneys, where I mostly handled eviction defense cases. During law school, I worked for the city and county government and, when I had my supervised practice of law license, I handled some prosecutions of very minor cases, like speeding and parking violations. So I have quite a bit of in-court time under my belt, but I do not know whether or to what extent that is desirable to a UK firm.

# Question

Is it feasible to find a job in the law in the UK before becoming a foreign qualified lawyer? How would I find recruiters in this space? I have heard of US firms in London recruiting American law graduates to work in corporate law, e.g., mergers and acquisitions, which I am more than willing to do, but I don't know where to start on that path. I am also willing to do a non-lawyer job where my qualifications could still be valuable, such as being a paralegal or legal assistant.

Any advice?



* Test Design
I asked students to tell me about their parents (or anything else they wanted if they did not like that topic). The goal was to test their ability to speak about characteristics and likes and dislikes to gauge how much of the material they have acquired and their conversation skills. I finished by asking a couple of vocabulary questions from different units. I tried to ask the questions in the context of what they had told me during the conversation part, e.g., "Is your mother taller than your father? Are you shorter than your father? How short are you?"

** Grading
I designed the test so that at least the top 20% of the class would get an A++ and at least the next 20% would get A+. A student would not get a B without struggling in all aspects of the test, with a maximum score of 3/2/2 (see below).

*** Rubric
I graded the students with a maximum of five points for each of three skills: Understanding, speaking, and vocabulary. I weigh understanding higher than speaking and speaking higher than vocabulary. Roughly, two points of vocabulary is one point of speaking and two points of speaking is one point of understanding. So if a student was struggling in understanding and speaking, I tested them a little more on vocabulary to give them a chance at a better grade.

** Example Vocabulary Questions
Below are questions I would resort to if I could not test the vocabulary in the context of what the students told me (which was rare).

1. Are you taller/shorter than him/her? How tall are you?
   - When I asked this question, I always asked if the same person was taller and shorter to make sure the student wasn't just saying "yes" or "no" randomly.
2. Make your fingers do a high jump. Make your fingers do a long jump.
3. Is your father at work? What does he do?
4. Would you like to live in the mountains or under the sea?
5. Are you a fan of pingpong?

* Absent Students

** A++
*** Kelvin 黎辰予 Li Chenyu
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

黎辰予 understands all of the material I tested and had no trouble understanding me even when I went outside the curriculum. He has reached an intermediate level of English and would benefit from consuming age-appropriate native-level literature, like Harry Potter.
*** Albus 刘廷诺 Liu Tingnuo
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

刘廷诺 has terrific English, and I think that comes largely from his love of reading in English. He changed his English name to Albus after a character from an English-language book, Harry Potter. One of the best things any intermediate language learner can do is read in the target language. I have no notes except to keep it up.

*** Timi 刘祐均 Liu Youjun
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

刘祐均 had no issues with input or output and understood me speaking beyond our classroom curriculum. I estimate that he has reached an intermediate English level and would benefit from reading or listening to native-level media for children or young adults. Perhaps Harry Potter or comic books.

| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 | 5       |          5 |

潘玉龙 had no difficulty with output or the vocabulary from the curriculum, but he did struggle a little to understand what I was saying. He would benefit from listening exercises and he /might/ be at the level that he can start to read graded literature, if his reading comprehension is better than his listening comprehension, which I suspect (because the reader can set the pace), but I did not test this.

| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

吴芊怡 has a fluid speech pattern and did not make any mistakes in speaking. She also understood me completely and mastered the vocabulary I tested. However, she implied she does not have a good grade in her other English class, so I do not know what caused that discrepancy. I think she would benefit from graded readers.

*** TT 夏宇彤 Xia Yutong
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |
夏宇彤 struggled to start because of a lack of confidence, but once she started talking, she was able to produce output accurately and she had mastered the vocabulary that I tested. She would benefit from fluency exercises to build her confidence.

*** Jessica 余瑾昕 Yu Jinxin

|             5 |        5 |          5 |

张艺 had no difficulty understanding me or speaking to me. She also had no issue with the vocabulary and had mastered the terms I tested, she even produced the assigned structures without me prompting her, so she has a strong grasp of the material. She would benefit from graded readers.

** A+
*** Leo 刘凯泽 Liu Kaize
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          4 |

刘凯泽 has good fluency and understanding of the material. I marked off one point from vocabulary because he did not understand the vocabulary word I used at first, but he understood with some help. His grammar is a bit off, but totally understandable, which is normal for his level of English. I recommend English reading to improve his grasp on English grammar patterns.

*** Alex 黄九皋 Huang Jiugao
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             4 |        5 |          4 |

黄九皋 had only a little trouble understanding me, but he had no trouble with speaking once he did understand me. He knew one vocabulary structure, but not another, so I took one point from vocabulary.

*** Torry 刘涛睿 Liu Taorui
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             4 |        5 |          4 |

刘涛睿 required some help understanding both vocabulary and non-vocabulary (input), but his output was very good. He did not have trouble with producing the English from the curriculum. I recommend listening to slow English for practice.

*** Henry 夏崇晖 Xia Chonghui
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             3 |        5 |          5 |

夏崇晖 struggled a bit to understand me, but he had no trouble producing structures from the curriculum, so he would benefit from more comprehension practice, which I will start in the next lesson.

*** Emily 陈米莉 Chen Mi Li
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        3 |          5 |

陈米莉 had no trouble understanding me and had no issue with the vocabulary, but she was very shy about speaking, so I was not able to give her a good speaking grade. I think building confidence is all she needs to improve her English significantly.

*** Linda 程子涵 Cheng Zihan
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             4 |        5 |          5 |

*** Candy Zhai 翟伟淇 Zhai Weiqi
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             4 |        5 |          5 |

翟伟淇 answered in full sentences and understood me for the most part. I think I confused her with one of my follow-up questions, and it made her misunderstand the next bit. She had no issue with the vocabulary and had mastered the terms I tested. She would benefit from fluency exercises to build her confidence.

*** Chen 吴辰 Wu Chen
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        2 |          5 |

吴辰 appeared to understand everything I said, but she was too scared to actually talk. She only said "yes" and "no." She would benefit from fluency exercises to build her confidence.

*** Leo 李星爵 Li Xingjue
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             4 |        4 |          3 |

李星爵 struggled a bit with understanding me, but he did not have much difficulty in speaking. I did not understand some of what he said, so I took one point from speaking. I think he knew the vocabulary, but he did not "have an ear" for it when I said the words, so he would benefit from some remedial English listening practice.

*** Jack 刘智豪 Liu Zhihao
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             3 |        3 |          5 |

刘智豪 had some difficulty understanding me generally, but he had no difficulty with the vocabulary. This indicates to me that he studies well from the book, but requires more help with actually using English. He would benefit from more practice listening. He may not be ready for speaking generally at this time because he lacks mastery of some of the basics, but research suggests that is common with language learners and does not necessarily suggest that he is underperforming. What it means is that I should do more comprehensible input with the basics to get him "up to speed."

*** Cherry 林昱汐 Lin Yuxi
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             4 |        3 |          4 |

林昱汐 had some difficulty understanding me and struggled to produce a sentence. She had some issues with the vocabulary, but they did not amount to misunderstanding, just to not knowing the words without context. She would benefit from more aural and oral practice.

** A
*** Nika 胡伊湄 Hu Yimei
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             3 |        3 |          4 |
I could not get 胡伊湄 to talk beyond "Yes," "No," and "My dad is tall." She was very nervous. She did understand some of the vocabulary, but not all of it. She would benefit from fluency exercises to build her confidence. She may be in a silent period of language acquisition.

*** Lucy 卢欣然 Lu Xinran
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             3 |        2 |          4 |

卢欣然 could not produce a sentence, but she gave single-word answers and showed understanding of most of the vocabulary. She understood "taller" but misunderstood "shorter":
- "Is your mom taller than your dad?"
- "No"
- "Is your dad taller than your mom?"
- "Yes"
- "Is your dad shorter than your mom?"
- "Yes"

*** Gavin 李辅天 Li Futian
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             2 |        3 |          3 |

李辅天 has some difficulty with understanding, and it seems to come more from being nervous than from lack of studying. I think he would benefit from a remedial English course of some kind so he can become more confident with his English.

*** Yoyo 赵昱辰 Zhao Yuchen
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             2 |        3 |          3 |

赵昱辰 had difficulty understanding me, and struggled a bit to produce the English from the curriculum, not understanding some vocabulary words. He would benefit from comprehension practices, which I will test in the next lesson.

** B
*** Alex 1 黄浩然 Huang Haoran
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             x |        x |          x |

黄浩然 was unwilling to take the test, so I could not administer it to him.

*** Xuchen 庞旭辰 Pang Xuchen
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             2 |        2 |          2 |

庞旭辰 struggled with understanding me without significant help, did not know most vocabulary, and was not able to produce some English even after I modeled it, so I think he requires some remedial English to build his understanding. I am afraid he will give up on English. A lot of his trouble comes from a lack of confidence, and when I could calm him down and make him look at my gestures, he understood more, so he can definitely get it if he becomes more interested in it. I will make a point of improving his understanding for the rest of the year. He has made me think I should reconsider one of my class strategies, so I will try something new to help him and others starting next week.

* Class 5

|             5 |        5 |          5 |
高天佑 had no trouble understanding me, spoke rather fluidly, and remembered all vocabulary. His only possibly mistake was that he said "high" instead of "tall" when he was talking about how tall someone was, but he did it in a way that made perfect sense, so it wasn't /truly/ an error. He has reached an intermediate level of English and would benefit from graded readers and/or native-level English literature.

| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

|             5 |        5 | 5         |
胡珀瑀 had no trouble understanding me, spoke rather fluidly, and remembered all vocabulary. Pacino is very hyperactive and he sometimes prevents other students from paying attention in class, but, much like me when I was his age, he is still paying attention even while causing disruptions to other students. Because he reminds me of myself, I believe I know what is happening: His brain starts to wander when he has already mastered a concept and he has no patience for other students to catch on. He has reached an intermediate level of English and would benefit from graded readers and/or native-level English literature.

Side note: He told me he is learning to fence, which is something I really wanted to do when I was his age too, so he reminds me of myself in many ways 😁

She did not know how to say how old she was, and, besides her name, she spoke to me only in Chinese. She would benefit from remedial English and a lot of comprehensible input in the form of very basic graded readers.

* Class 6
This class is perhaps my best performing class for English. Many of the students in this class have reached an intermediate level on par with some of my 7th graders. Many in this class have a good grasp of the material, but stammer when producing it either through a lack of confidence or a lack of fluency (passing everything through the "filter" of grammar rules they have learned). I plan to remedy this with a fluency based approach for the remaining lessons.

*** Levie 曾力为 Zeng Liwei
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             4 |        5 |        5 |

曾力为 understands most of what I said and tested. He had some difficulty with some of the vocabulary at first, but it was only because the class had gotten loud because when I asked him to clarify, he said something different. He would benefit from more aural practice and graded readers.

| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             3 |        3 |          4 |
刘子妃 had some trouble understanding me even with help, could not produce any English besides "I have a brother," and remembered most vocabulary. She would benefit from very basic graded readers and maybe some remedial English.

*** Steven 郑城熙 Zheng Chengxi
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             3 |        3 |          4 |

郑城熙 struggles with understanding me in most situations. I asked him to say anything to me in English and he could not do it, even with help from other students. He would benefit from remedial English and very basic graded readers.

*** Jason 赵星睿 Zhao Xingrui
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             3 |        3 |        2 |       |

赵星睿 could not produce a full sentence in English. He understood some of what I said with some help. He was mostly able only to say "yes" and "no," and he was not able to do so accurately about most vocabulary. He would benefit from remedial English to catch him up with the other students.

*** Adkins 张铠泓 Zhang Kaihong
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             3 |        2 | 3       |

张铠泓 could not produce a full sentence in English. He was able only to say "yes" and "no," and he was not able to do so accurately about some vocabulary. He would benefit from remedial English to catch him up with the other students.

* Class 7
Many in this class have a good grasp of the material, but stammer when producing it either through a lack of confidence or a lack of fluency (passing everything through the "filter" of grammar rules they have learned). I plan to remedy this with a fluency based approach for the remaining lessons.

** A++
*** Ryan 蔡昊霖 Cai Haolin
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

蔡昊霖 did well on speaking and understanding, but he understood me to say "family" when I said "parents." Many other students did this, so I think it's more a cultural differnece than a language difference. I recommend reading and listening practice to continue to improve.

*** Eason 陈伯勋 Chen Boxun

|             5 |        5 |          5 |

冯羽彤 understands all of the material I tested and had no trouble understanding me even when I went outside the curriculum. While she always produces the correct output, she stammers as she does it, which indicates she would benefit from focusing more on fluency, something I think many in this class have in common.

|             5 |        5 |          5 |

He always produces the correct output, but he stammers as he does it, with some grammar errors but no meaning errors, which indicates he would benefit from focusing more on fluency, something I think many in this class have in common.

胡科扬 understands all of the material I tested and had no trouble understanding me, even when I went outside the curriculum.

|             5 |        5 | 5          |

刘弘毅 understood everything I said, even when I went outside the curriculum. He has very good pronunciation, but he stammers when he speaks, so I think he would benefit from fluency-based lessons. I also think he has reached a level where he would benefit from graded readers.

| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

王君悦 has very good speaking fluency, he stammers only when he forgets a specific word and has to figure out how to speak around the problem. He has reached an intermediate level and would benefit from reading graded or native-level literature. He would also benefit from watching English-language videos without Chinese subtitles (English subtitles are fine).

*** Alaiya 王文一 Wang Wenyi
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

Alaiya understands all of the material I tested but had some trouble understanding me when I went outside the curriculum. It seems her confidence with English is still developing, and would benefit from a lot more comprehensible input so she can reach an intermediate level. It is close, but not quite there.

*** Lusy 王语泽 Wang Yuze
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

王语泽 understands all of the material I tested and had no trouble understanding me even when I went outside the curriculum. For time constraints, I could not test enough to see if I felt she was at an intermediate level, but I think she would benefit from graded English-langauge media.

*** James 王子睿 Wang Zirui
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

王子睿 understands all of the material I tested and had no trouble understanding me even when I went outside the curriculum.

*** Wendy 王梓宁 Wang Zining
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

*** Harris 徐沣   Xu Feng
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 | 5         |

徐沣 understands all of the material I tested and had no trouble understanding me even when I went outside the curriculum. He made some small grammar errors, but no meaning errors, so he would benefit from more pattern recognition coming from slow comprehensible input, maybe in a graded reader or listening practice.

*** Ivy 夏小涵 Xia Xiaohan
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

夏小涵 understands all of the material, but struggled for a bit to bring vocabulary to mind, so I think what she needs is to develop fluency. She would benefit from more comprehensible input to build her fluency and confidence.

*** Angela 谢予涵 Xie Yuhan
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

谢予涵 has no trouble understanding me and speaks very well, with zero meaning errors and a few grammar errors. Because of time constraints, I was not able to conclude if she has reached an intermediate level, but I still think she has reached a level high enough that she would benefit from graded literature.

*** Alina 杨荞语 Yang Qiaohua
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

杨荞语 understands all of the material I tested and had no trouble understanding me, even when I went outside the curriculum. She made some small grammar errors, but no meaning errors. She has excellent pronunciation for her level. She would benefit from graded readers.

*** Zoey 周乐儿
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

周乐儿 understands all of the material I tested and had only a little trouble understanding me, but she understood when I repeated myself, so it seems to have been nerves rather than not understanding me. She made some small grammar errors, but no meaning errors. She would benefit from comprehensible input in the form of slow-listening aural practice and graded readers.

*** Aimee 周昱妍
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

周昱妍 understands all of the material I tested, but was a little too nervous to speak fluently to me. She would benefit from aural practice and graded readers.

*** Emma 叶子涵
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 | 5         |

叶子涵 understands all of the material I tested and had no trouble understanding me. She made some small grammar errors, but no meaning errors. She speaks relatively fluently and would benefit from more comprehensible input in the form of slow listening aural practice and graded readers.

*** Maco 杨翰文 Yang Hanwen
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

杨翰文 understands all of the material I tested and had no trouble understanding me. He speaks words that he knows relatively fluently, but when he does not immediately know what to say, he stammers and gives up, which indicates a lack of confidence. I can tell his understanding is high, he just has low confidence. He would benefit from more comprehensible input in the form of slow listening aural practice and graded readers because it will give him better circumlocution for when he does not know how to say something.

*** Candy 张沛健 Zhang Peijian
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

张沛健 understands all of the material I tested and had no trouble understanding me. Due to time constraints, I could not see how well she performed outside the curriculum, but it seems she has reached or is close to an intermediate level of English. She would likely benefit from graded readers.

*** Jelly 于昕灵
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          4 |

于昕灵 understands all of the material I tested and had no trouble understanding me. She made some small grammar errors, but no meaning errors. She forgot "centimeters" when talking about height, but she got the other vocabulary correct. She would benefit from comprehensible input in the form of slow listening aural practice and graded readers.

*** Colin 胡科名 Hu Keming
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          4 |

胡科名 understands all of the material I tested and had no trouble understanding me, excepting when I went outside the curriculum. He generally produces the correct output, with some grammar errors and some minor meaning errors, which indicates he would benefit from focusing more on fluency, something I think many in this class have in common.

*** Jack 李泽霖 Li Zelin
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          4 |

李泽霖 understands what I say well. He did a high jump when I said "long jump," but understood the other vocabulary. He stammers when he speaks because he filters everything he says through his grammar filter, but he speaks correctly.

*** Cindy 王暄   Wang Xuan
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 | 4         |

I had a small amount of difficulty understanding 王暄's speech at the beginning. I think she was trying to say "My mom and dad are alive," but I heard "My mom is a liar and my dad is a liar." However, that is not part of the curriculum, so it is ok that she has not acquired that yet and I did not count off for speaking as a result. She missed the first vocabulary point, but she understood my follow-up question with no issue, so I took one point.

*** Amanda 张正伊 张正伊
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          4 |

张正伊 understands all of the material I tested and had no trouble understanding me. She made some small grammar errors, but no meaning errors. She forgot "centimeters" when talking about height (she said she was 146 kilometers tall 🙂), but she got the other vocabulary correct. She would benefit from comprehensible input in the form of slow listening aural practice and graded readers.

*** Wesley 伏钰汶
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             4 |        5 |          5 |

伏钰汶 had only a little trouble understanding me, but he has mastered the material I tested and speaks with few errors beyond minor grammar errors. He would benefit from more aural practice.

*** Candy 周密
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             4 |        5 |          5 |

周密 understands all of the material I tested and had only a little trouble understanding me, but she understood with a small amount of help. She made some small grammar errors, but no meaning errors. She would benefit from aural practice.
*** William 涂建灏 Tu Jianhao
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             4 |        5 | 4         |

涂建灏 would benefit from more comprehensible input because he has not fully acquired some basic structures, e.g., saying "it" when he means "she" and saying "I taller" instead of "I am taller," but he understands it well enough. He just needs more listening practice.

*** Ellen 冯馨阅 Feng Xinyue
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             4 |        5 |          4 |

冯馨阅 understood most of the vocabulary, but she did miss a bit, so I recommend studying the vocabulary more. She will benefit from a fluency-based approach in my class, which I will start next week.

*** Bella 江怡娴 Jiang Yixian
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             4 |        5 |          4 |

江怡娴 understands most of the material I tested and had some trouble understanding me, and she did miss some vocabulary. She struggles to produce output, which indicates a lack of confidence, so fluency exercises should help her. It seems to me that she is developing her confidence in producing output even while she understands the input. She needs more comprehensible input to build her confidence and fluency.

** A
*** Wilson 吴奕臻 Wu Yizhen
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             4 |        5 | 3          |

吴奕臻 had some difficulty understanding me when I said some basic things, e.g., "do this with your fingers," but he understood the material I tested. He would benefit from listening exercises and fluency practice. He had no difficulty producing output when he understood the question.

*** Bobo 金浩轩 Jin Haoxuan
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             3 |        5 | 4         |

金浩轩 struggles significantly with understanding without help. He understood some of the vocabulary, but he was not confident with it. I unfortunately called out 靳鸿戈 at the same time as 金浩轩, and their relationship distracted him during his test because they were joking with each other in Chinese while I was trying to test his English. I think he would do better in an isolated environment where he would look to me for help understanding instead of to his friend. That said, his output was fine and I had no trouble understanding him. What he needs is more practice listening.

*** Polin 全泊霖 Quan Bolin
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             3 |        4 |          4 |

全泊霖 did not understand me very well and he said "I don't know" in Chinese instead of in English, which is a phrase he should probably know at this point, so I took one point for that. He struggled with "taller," which is a vocabulary word, but when I modified the word to test his grasp of it, he understood it fully, and he used the right vocabulary words associated with it "I am 165 cm tall". He lacks confidence, but I can tell he understands more than he thinks. It seems he second-guesses himself and convinces himself that he doesn't understand. I think he would benefit from more comprehensible input.

*** Andy 郑熙麒 Zheng Xiqi
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             3 |        3 |          4 |

郑熙麒 had some trouble understanding me, but he understood the main questions with a little help. He stammers when he speaks. He would benefit from more aural practice.

*** Harry 刘曙豪
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             3 |        3 |          3 |

刘曙豪 had significant trouble understanding me, and I had to translate some basic words for him to understand my questions. He could not make a sentence without resorting to some Chinese. He would benefit from some remedial English to catch him up to the rest of the class. He needs lots of comprehensible input, so I would recommend some very basic graded readers.

*** Eric 靳鸿戈 Jin Hongge
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             2 |        4 | 5         |

靳鸿戈 was distracted by 金浩轩 at the beginning. I think they use each other as a crutch when the material is challenging, so I sent 金浩轩 away. 靳鸿戈 had trouble understanding my questions, even when I made them quite basic, e.g.,
- Me: "How many brothers do you have?"
- Him: "No."
- Me: "How many sisters do you have?"
- Him: "Yes."
- Me: "How many?"
- Him: "23."

He did understand that I was looking for a number when I said "how many?" but he gave her age, thinking I was asking "how old is she?".

That said, when I used words that were assigned in vocabulary, like "taller," he understood it perfectly. 靳鸿戈 would benefit from remedial English studying. At the present time, I think he should do a focused study on questions: Who, what, which, when, where, why, how many, etc.

*** Mack 陈昊   Chen Hao
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

陈昊 understands all of the material I tested and had no trouble understanding me, and he spoke with vocabulary words without my prompting. He would benefit from more practice reading.

*** Vicky 陈慧琦 Chen Huiqi
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

陈慧琦 has problems with fluency but she understood everything I said, even when I went outside the curriculum. She likes to watch anime, so she may benefit from reading manga (Japanese graphic novels in anime style) in English. Blue Lock (蓝色监狱) has been translated into an English-language manga, and I think she (and her friends in the Blue Lock fandom) would love it. I recommend she find English-language mangas she likes. The relatively low number of words per page and the high visual context would help her reach an intermediate level very quickly.

*** Jackson 陈建维 Chen Jianwei
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

陈建维 understands all of the material I tested and had no trouble understanding me even when I went outside the curriculum, and he produces correct output, but he struggles with fluency because of his filter. He did make some minor grammar errors, but no meaning errors. He would benefit from graded readers.

*** Edison 程宇墨 Cheng Yumo
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

程宇墨 understands all of the material I tested and had no trouble understanding me even when I went outside the curriculum. He does not stammer when he speaks, but he does have to process what I said for a couple moments before he can begin to produce the output. He made some minor grammar errors, but no meaning errors. He would benefit from graded readers.

*** Ivy 崔秋仪 Cui Qiuyi
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

崔秋仪 understands all of the material I tested and had no trouble understanding me even when I went outside the curriculum. I believe she has reached an intermediate level of English and would benefit from consuming graded (possibly native-level) English literature.

|             5 |        5 | 5         |

|             5 |        5 | 5          |

*** Edward 李燊   Li Shen
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 | 5         |

李燊's English is highly advanced. He should (continue to) read native-level English literature.

*** Amy 李炘芯 Li Xinxin
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

李炘芯 understands all of the material I tested and had only a little trouble understanding me, but she understood when I repeated, so I did not have to give any help and gave her full points. She also understood me when I went outside the curriculum. She stammers when she speaks, so I think she would benefit from something to build her confidence and fluency. She will benefit from more aural comprehensible input.

*** Lisa 李梓菡 Li Zihan
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

李梓菡 struggled to understand me without me repeating myself, but she understands all the material. She would benefit from more aural comprehensible input.

*** Lynn 林诗诗 Lin Shishi
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

林诗诗 understands all of the material I tested and had no trouble understanding me even when I went outside the curriculum. She stammers when she speaks, so she would benefit from more pattern recognition practice, both aural and written comprehensible input. She also makes some basic grammar errors (including saying "she" instead of "he"), but there were no meaning errors, so full points.

*** Yancy 刘又瑄 Liu Youxuan
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

刘又瑄 understands all of the material I tested and had no trouble understanding me even when I went outside the curriculum. Because of time constraints, I could not determine if his level is intermediate, but I think he would benefit from graded readers.

苏婧秋 understands all of the material I tested and has no trouble understanding me even when I go outside the curriculum. She likes to watch anime, so she may benefit from reading manga (Japanese graphic novels in anime style) in English. I think she (and her friends in the anime fandom) would love it. I recommend she find English-language mangas she likes. The relatively low number of words per page and the high visual context would help her reach an intermediate level very quickly.

文熙媛 understands all of the material I tested and has no trouble understanding me even when I go outside the curriculum. She has a good command of English and has reached an intermediate level, so I think she would benefit from consuming simple native-level literature.

肖雅灵 understands all of the material I tested and has no trouble understanding me even when I go outside the curriculum. She answers very quickly, which indicates she has mastered her listening ability for the material. She has reached an intermediate level of English and would benefit from consuming graded or native-level literature.

*** Ken 姚煜坤 Yao Yukun
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

Class monitor. He stammers and has some trouble with grammar in his spoken output (particulary in producing pronouns properly), but not in a way that confuses meaning, so I took no points. He understands all of the material I tested and has no trouble understanding me even when I go outside the curriculum. He would benefit from graded readers.

|             5 |        5 |          5 |

周若晴 understands all of the material I tested and has no trouble understanding me even when I go outside the curriculum. Because of time constraints, I could not determine if she has reached an intermediate level of English, but she may have, and so I think she would benefit from consuming native-level or graded readers.

*** Zoe 周梓墨 Zhou Zimo
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |      4.5 |          5 |

周梓墨 understands all of the material I tested, but I was not always able to understand what she said. That said, it was very loud because class had just ended while I tested her, so I gave her an extra half point because I might have understood her without all the racket. Either way, she stammered, so I think she would benefit from more comprehensible input to develop her confidence and fluency.

*** Jimmy 边无际
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          5 |

|             5 |        5 |          5 |

I believe 范宇卓's English is at a native level. I have nothing to improve on in the context of this class. To improve his English beyond its current level, I would recommend academic practice, e.g., reading and writing about history or science.

*** Sunny 胡智涵 Hu Zhihan
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          4 |

胡智涵 understands all of the material I tested and had no trouble understanding me. She had only a small mistake in vocabulary, but she understood her mistake when I said "kilogram is 'kg'". She would benefit from consuming graded readers.

*** Rey 邓子锐 Deng Zirui
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             5 |        5 |          4 |

邓子锐 understands all of the material I tested and had no trouble understanding me except when I went too far outside the curriculum. He makes some minor grammar mistakes, but he had no meaning errors. He had only a small mistake in vocabulary but it did not indicate a problem to me. I believe he has reached an intermediate level of English and would benefit from consuming graded readers.

*** Chen 陈彦良 Chen Yanliang
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             4 |        4 | 5         |
陈彦良 stammers when he speaks, but his understanding is good. He did misunderstand me a couple of times, but he has no issue with the vocabulary. He would benefit from more aural practice.

*** Celine 应明珍 Ying Mingzhen
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             4 |        5 |          4 |

应明珍 had difficulty understanding me at times, but she understood with a little help. She pronounced 'eight' like 'ache', so I almost thought she did not understand me. She also had a little trouble with some of the vocabulary. She would benefit from aural comprehension practice.

*** Alia 金梓洋 Jin Ziyang
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             4 |        4 |          5 |

金梓洋 struggles to understand without some help, but she was able to produce the necessary English to show she knew the vocabulary. She would benefit from graded English listening practice to improve her comprehension.

*** Robert 黄皓轩 Huang Haoxuan
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             3 |        5 |          5 |

黄皓轩 struggles to understand me without some help, but he knows the vocabulary and he did not have trouble with using it. He would benefit from more comprehensible input so he can develop better listening comprehension.

*** Momo 胡瑾桐 Hu Jintong
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             4 |        5 | 2         |

胡瑾桐 struggled to understand me, but most of her understanding problems came from the vocabulary, so she would benefit from seeing the vocabulary more in context.  I believe she does not have as much difficulty in reading English as she does in hearing it. When I spoke about simple things that were not the vocabulary, she was able to follow me. She would benefit from more comprehensible input so she can begin to recognize the patterns in English speech.

*** Lucy 彭予露 Peng Yulu
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             4 |        4 |          2 |

彭予露 mostly understood me, but she was not able to understand most of the vocabulary words. When she spoke, I understood almost all of what she said, but I did not understand some key bits, so I took off one point from speaking.

*** William 阚明哲 Kan Mingzhe
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             3 |        4 |          2 |

阚明哲 struggles to understand some basic English and he was not able to understand some vocabulary words even with my help. His speech has some simple grammar errors, e.g., "My father is tall, my mother is short" because he did not know the vocabulary "taller" or "shorter" when I asked "Is your father taller than your mother?," a question he did not initially understand. He would benefit from more comprehensible input, which I will focus on for the remainder of the lessons this semester.

*** Keno 万凯诺 Wankaino
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             3 |        4 | 2         |

万凯诺 struggled to understand me and was not familiar with the vocabulary at all. When he spoke, he had to use a lot of Chinese to fill in the gaps. He would benefit from a lot of total physical response/comprehensible input on activity words, I think. He does not lack confidence, he just lacks comprehension.

Me: Are you taller than your mom?
Him: No.
Me: Are you shorter than your mom?
Him: No.
Me: Who is taller, you or your mom?
Him: I don't know.

*** Ian 黄子恩 Huang Zien
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             3 |        3 |          3 |

黄子恩  struggles to understand me without some help, and he is not able to produce some important, basic English. He would benefit from more study of the vocabulary and a lot more comprehenisble input.

*** Angela 黄莉媛 Huang Liyuan
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             3 |        2 |          5 |

黄莉媛 could not speak because she was too nervous. She only said 不会不会. She had a lot of trouble understanding me, but she knew all of the vocabulary. She would benefit from aural practice and graded readers to build her confidence.

*** Aden 林峻霆 Lin Junting
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             3 |        3 |          2 |

林峻霆 struggled to produce any English and struggled to understand most of what I said without signficant help. He is more than willing to try, so shyness does not appear to be the issue, but lack of confidence in English may play a part. He wanted to speak to me only in Chinese. I believe he would benefit from remedial English to catch up to the rest of the class. He needs lots of comprehensible input, so I would recommend some very basic graded readers.

*** Sophie 曾子涵 Zeng Zihan
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|           2.5 |        3 |          4 |

曾子涵 has trouble understanding me, and I think her trouble stems from a lack confidence. 陈慧琦 was, I think, distracting her because they were nervous about the test. There were other distractions from other students passing by while we did the test, so I have given her a half point to understanding because I think she may have done better in a more isolated environment. She would benefit from more comprehensible input and fluency lessons, which I will start from next lesson.

*** Charlie 李佰阳 Li Baiyang
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             2 |        3 |          4 |

李佰阳 struggles a lot to understand even with translation. He missed a vocabulary question but then, on the follow-up question, corrected himself on the bit he got wrong. He would benefit from more comprehensible input, which I will focus on for the remainder of the lessons this semester.

*** Helen 王亦晗 Wang Yihan
| Understanding | Speaking | Vocabulary |
|             2 |        2 |          4 |

王亦晗 struggled to produce any English and struggled to understand most of what I said without signficant help. She was unable to produce any full sentence, even when I told her she can say anything and with help from her friends. I believe this is primarily an issue of confidence because I am certain she can say at least one sentence in English, she was just too nervous. She was able to understand my vocabulary portion and she answered it mostly correctly, just without any full sentences. She would benefit from a lot more comprehensible input, some remedial English and basic graded readers.
