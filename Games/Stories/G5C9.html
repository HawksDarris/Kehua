    <div class="container">
      <p>Miya was my penguin. It was Eric's first day of school. Eric sleeps on a sofa on the roof of his house in America. </p>
      <p>When he wakes up at 8:00 AM, his hair is very messy. He does not know how to get ready for school, so he combs his hair with knifescissors. It does not work. He does not understand. He tries again. It does not work again. He tries three more times. Now he is bald. His school is in UK, China. He always gets to school on time. He walks on foot from America to the ocean, then his legs are too tired, so he jumps three times and flies to UK, China. Class starts at 8:00 AM and he arrives at 10:00 AM, but he is always on time because everyone at the school thinks class does not start until the bell rings, and Eric rings the bell when he flies to the school. </p>
