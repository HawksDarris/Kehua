      <p>On Sunny the Penguin's first day of school, he woke up. He did not know how to open his eyes. That is why he had a robot to open his eyes for him.</p> 

      <p>He slept on a jellyfish. He did not get off the jellyfish by himself, he got off the jellyfish by Darris. Darris picked him up and put him on the floor beside the jellyfish. He went to school by paper airplane.</p>
